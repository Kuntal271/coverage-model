Provides a Java API to parse and collect code coverage results. This API is a companion module for the [Static Analysis Model and Parsers Library](https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model) that does the same kind of thing for static analysis results. See the Jenkins [Coverage Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/coverage-plugin) to see on how to use this API in practice.
